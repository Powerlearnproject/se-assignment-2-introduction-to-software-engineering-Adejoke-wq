# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering involves designing and developing software,while traditional programming involves the conventional approach of writing code to create specific instructions for a computer to follow. 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
SDLC is a process for analysis, development and testing , implementation, documentation, and evaluation of a software.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
PHASE 1 : Planning and gathering requirements.
PHASE 2: Requirements analysis: identifying the expectations of the users from the software.
PHASE 3: Design : this involves building the framework and structure.
PHASE 4 : CODING: When the software design isconverted into tangible code.
PHASE 5: Testing: when errors and gliches that might have slipped through is detected.
PHASE 6: Deployment: This includes launching the software and ensuring the users can operate it with ease.
PHASE 7: Maintenance : improvement to ensure longevity.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self organizing and cross functional teams. Waterfall is a linear approach, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next phase.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting,and maintaining requirements. It involves activities like elicitation, analysis,specification, and verification to ensure software meets needs.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design means breaking complex software systems into smaller components. Modularity improves maintainability by isolating changes and reducing complexity. It improves scalability by allowing easy addition and removal of components.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
* UNIT TESTING: to validate the performance of unit components.
* INTEGRATION TESTING: finds the data flow from  one modules to other modules.
* SYSTEM TESTING: to identify that the meets specification and requirements.
* ACCEPTANCE TESTING: to evaluate if the system is ready for deployment.
        Testing is crucial in software development because it identifies potential issues before reaching end users.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
        Version control systems are tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
        Version control systems are important because it controls computer files and versions of files.
  EXAMPLES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS 
  # GitHub #Beanstalk # GitLab # PerForce # Mercurial.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager is responsible for communicating project status, managing changes and requesting resources to help complete the project.
        CHALLENGES FACED IN MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
        # Communication problems
        # Unrealistic deadlines
        # Budget
        # Lack of accountability
        # Change management.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
    Software maintainance is the process which helps to upgrade, modify and update software to stay up with client needs.
  MAINTAINANCE ACTIVITIES OF A SOFTWARE
  # Correcting and fixing defects
  # Adapting to the environment
  # Enhancing attributes
  # Preventing problems.
        Maintainance is an essential part of the software lifecycle because it ensures that the software continues to function as it was designed to.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ETHICAL ISSUES THAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS MIGHT FACE
# Knowledge gap
# Unethical data collection
# Security
       Engineers can ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work by participating in education and training.
